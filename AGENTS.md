# MatchBox Agent Instructions

## What is MatchBox

MatchBox is a custom VM for BoxLang, a spiritual successor to CFML. It aims for compatibility with the BoxLang JVM reference implementation while targeting environments where the JVM struggles: WebAssembly, ESP32, cloud functions, and native binaries.

The VM includes tiered JIT compilation (Cranelift backend) for hot code paths, NaN-boxed values for efficient memory use, and generational garbage collection.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build                    # Build
cargo test                     # Run all tests
cargo test vm_array_bifs       # Run specific test
cargo test --test boxlang_compat_tests  # Run the BoxLang compat transfer suite
cargo clippy                   # Lint
cargo build --release --features "bif-http,bif-zip"  # Verify release build
```

## Project Structure

- `crates/matchbox-vm/src/bifs/mod.rs` — Native Rust BIFs
- `crates/matchbox-compiler/src/prelude.bxs` — Prelude BIFs (BoxLang)
- `tests/scripts/` — Integration test scripts (.bxs)
- `tests/integration_tests.rs` — Test registration
- `reference/boxlang/` — BoxLang JVM reference (read-only)
- `BIF_STATUS.md` — BIF implementation tracking

## Adding BIFs

Load the `add-bif` skill. It covers:
- Prelude vs native decision tree
- Implementation patterns
- Testing workflow
- Registration steps

## BoxLang Reference

Load the `reference-boxlang` skill. BoxLang JVM defines canonical behavior. Always check it first.


## Engineering Principles

- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
